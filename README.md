# Powersistance

A powershell script for persistance!
You can use this to persist any process you want.
It does require you change 2 variables... so obviously that's some <strong>OSCP</strong> shit right there.

Step1: download script.
<br>
<br>
Step2: change the variables $pathofscript(relative path to dir of the script) and $persist(process to persist) to match what you require.
<br>
<br>
Step3: run on the target system.
